## ⚡ The short version

I build things that **ship, scale, and work in production.** Not just on localhost.

I'm the founder and sole engineer behind **[HireJourney](https://hirejourney.xyz)** - a live, full-stack AI career platform with real users, real payment infrastructure, and 40+ production APIs built from scratch. Alongside it, I've shipped an AI-driven crypto trading bot, a full-stack e-commerce platform, and mobile apps for fintech and healthcare clients - independently and as part of engineering teams.

Before HireJourney: backend engineer at a logistics/fintech startup, mobile intern at a UK fintech, and 1+ year freelancing for international clients. I've been delivering outcomes since before I had titles.

> _I didn't get here through connections or pedigree. I earned it by learning fast, building fast, and shipping things that actually work._

## 📂 Notable Projects

---

**📈 Crypto Signal Bot: AI-Driven Market Analysis on Telegram**

> An automated trading signal bot that pulls live market data and financial news, then combines technical and fundamental analysis into a single output - delivered in real time through a Telegram bot interface.
>
> Technical signals are computed with a Pandas-driven EMA engine tracking crypto pairs, while an LLM (via OpenRouter/Claude) reads and scores sentiment from live news sources - CoinTelegraph, CoinDesk, ForexFactory - alongside funding-rate data pulled from CoinGecko and Binance. The two signals are merged into one recommendation and pushed straight to the user's Telegram.
>
> Not a wrapper around an API. A multi-source data pipeline with AI reasoning on top.

`Python · FastAPI · Pandas · OpenRouter (Claude) · CoinGecko · Binance API · Redis · NeonDB · Docker · Fly.io`

---

**👟 Shoe Store E-Commerce Platform**

> A full-stack e-commerce platform for a shoe retailer, built with a customer storefront and a separate admin dashboard for managing inventory, orders, and products end to end.
>
> Product imagery runs through Cloudinary for upload and delivery, and checkout is handled via Paystack - a complete buy-side and manage-side system, not just a storefront template.

`Next.js · TypeScript · NeonDB · Drizzle ORM · Cloudinary · Paystack`

---

**🦻 CommsBridge: AI Assistive Communication Platform**

> Real-world accessibility infrastructure for hearing-impaired users, built as a full cross-platform system, not a demo.
>
> CommsBridge handles live speech-to-text transcription, multilingual translation, AI-powered conversation summarization, and real-time environmental hazard detection using audio classification models. The audio processing pipeline was optimized to run ~40% faster than the initial implementation, with TensorFlow's YAMNet model powering background sound event detection (sirens, alarms, collisions) while the user communicates.
>
> Built across a Flutter mobile client and a separate AI backend service. Two codebases. One cohesive product.

`Java · Spring Boot · Flutter · Python · FastAPI · TensorFlow · YAMNet · Gemini · AssemblyAI · Cloudinary · MySQL`

---

**💄 Fabhands: Client Acquisition Platform for a Freelance Artist**

> Not a template. Not a landing page. A complete client acquisition system built for a real freelance makeup artist operating in the UK market.
>
> Before Fabhands, the artist was fielding the same pricing and availability questions repeatedly across DMs and WhatsApp. The platform centralized everything - a link-in-bio with a live digital brochure, integrated appointment booking, and service pricing - into one shareable URL. Fewer repetitive enquiries. More direct bookings. A professional presence that converts.

[`Live Demo →`](https://fabhands-link.vercel.app/) | `React · Vite · TailwindCSS · Vercel`

**📦 Consumer Data Ingestion System**

> A backend-heavy system engineered to ingest, store, and query large volumes of consumer datasets reliably at scale.
>
> Scalability was the first principle. The API supports multi-field filtering and offset-based pagination, keeping response times consistent as dataset volume grows. The architecture separates ingestion from retrieval so pipelines can be extended independently without touching query logic. Full API collection documented and publicly available via Postman.

**📓 Trading Journal**

> A personal tool for logging trades and tracking performance stats over time - built to answer a simple question honestly: am I actually improving, or does it just feel that way?

## 📌 About the repos

Most of my production work, **including the full HireJourney codebase**, lives in private repositories. Some client work is under NDA - including a fintech loan app (KYC + repayment flows) and a healthcare mobile app - and some earlier contributions were on internal platforms with no public commit trail.

**What's public here is a fraction of what's been built and shipped.**

I'm actively shifting to build more in public: more open source, more case studies, more showing the work. Stay tuned.

## 📬 Let's talk

If your team needs someone who **ships in Week 1, not Month 3**, I'm open to remote roles and relocation.
