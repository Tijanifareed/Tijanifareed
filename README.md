📌 Note
This isn’t a new GitHub account but some of my earlier work lives in private repos, under NDA agreements, or was done through client platforms where public contributions weren't possible.

Now, I’m making a conscious shift to build and share more work in public, including open-source projects, case studies, and experimental builds.

More is coming stay tuned.
